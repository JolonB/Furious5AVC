This repository contains all the code files that contain enough code to get through
the first 2 quadrants.  
Feel free to look through them and see if you think any look good, or even try changing
one to make it work better.

If I remember correctly, `stuffy.cpp` managed to make it to the end of the third quadrant.
`charlottesAttempt.cpp` is a better version of `thisWorks.cpp` (because when reaches the end
of Q3, it will drive forward to cover some distance in Q4) which has made it to the end
of Q3 (sometimes). `latest.cpp` is the most updated one, however, it only seems to make it
to the end of Q2 because it has always messed up at some point in Q3.

A lot of the files are very similar, so if you see some that are exactly the same, you can
delete them if you like.

I can't be bothered adding Henry's code manually, so you can just find it [here](https://github.com/JolonB/Furious5AVC/blob/Henry's-Branch/main.cpp)
