### C++ Template
A template for your C++ code can be found [here](https://github.com/JolonB/Furious5AVC/blob/master/c%2B%2BTemplate.cpp). Make sure
you have the [E101.h](https://github.com/JolonB/Furious5AVC/blob/master/E101.h) library in the same folder as the code you write.

### Cloning/Downloading
#### Repository
In the terminal enter: `git clone http://www.github.com/JolonB/Furious5AVC/` or `git clone git@github.com:JolonB/Furious5AVC.git`. If you follow either of these with a file path on the Pi or your PC, it will save it there.

#### Branch
If you only want to clone a branch, enter: `git clone -b <branch> git@github.com:JolonB/Furious5AVC.git`.

Alternatively, you can just press the green Clone or download button in the repo and then press Download ZIP.

[Here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/) is some documentation 
about setting up access to the Pi from a remote computer. We can do this sometime.
This [VNC](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md) thing sounds
pretty good.
